# Summary
Two games created in Python for my final assignment in my Intro to Computer Science course

# Minesweeper
Asked my teacher for a challenging idea and he suggested doing Minesweeper with recursion. We had not covered recursion at the time (it was a Grade 11 course) so it was a fun challenge to learn it and implement it into the game.

# Flood
I saw a version of this game on the Apple App store and decided it would be cool to make in Python. Handed it in as part of my final project for style points.
